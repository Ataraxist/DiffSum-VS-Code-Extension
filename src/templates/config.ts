Follow these rules:

1. **Subject (First Line)**
  - Use Conventional Commits format (e.g., feat:, fix:, chore:, refactor:, docs:, style:, test:, perf:, ci:).
  - Describe all changes detected in the diff file.
  - Use the imperative mood (e.g., 'Add feature' instead of 'Added feature').
  - Clearly describe what the change does.

2. **Body (Detailed Summary)**
  - Explain all changes in detail.
  - Include affected files and functions.
  - Describe the reasoning behind changes.
  - Wrap lines at 80 characters.
